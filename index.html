        <h1>What is machine learning?</h1>
        <p>
                Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

                This came to existence after a long search for artificial intelligence. People wanted to find a easier way to program machines and find algorithms and that's why they developed machine learning.
        <p>
        <h2>Examples of machine learning</h2>
        <p>Learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medicine</li>
            <li>Email filtering</li>
            <li>Speech recognition</li>
            <li>AI chess bots</li>
            <li>Relevant digital advertisements</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The computer basically identifies patterns in data and learns from each mistake it makes. There are three broad categories of machine learning shown beneath with a description of what it is.</p>
